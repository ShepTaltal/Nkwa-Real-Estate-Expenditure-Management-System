3.Bank Account Ledger

-Objective:
-Track multiple bank accounts
-Store:
-Account ID, Bank Name, Balance, List of Expenditure Codes
-Use HashMap for retrieval
-Show relationships if needed (optional: graphs
-The provided Java code implements a simple console application for managing bank accounts and linking expenditures to those accounts. 

Code Breakdown

1. BankAccount Class:
   - This class represents a bank account with attributes: `accountId`, `bankName`, `balance`, and a list of `expenditureCodes`.
   - It has a constructor to initialize these attributes and an overridden `toString` method for displaying account details.

2. BankLedger Class:
   - This is the main class containing the `main` method and the logic for the application.
   - It uses a `HashMap` to store bank accounts, where the key is the account ID and the value is the `BankAccount` object.

3. Main Menu:
   - The application runs in a loop, displaying a menu with options to add a bank account, view a specific account, view all accounts, link an expenditure to an account, or exit the application.
   - User input is handled using a `Scanner`.

4. Adding Bank Accounts:
   - The `addAccount` method prompts the user for the account ID, bank name, and initial balance. It creates a new `BankAccount` object and stores it in the `HashMap`.

5. Viewing a Specific Account:
   - The `viewAccount` method allows the user to enter an account ID and retrieves the corresponding `BankAccount` object from the `HashMap`, displaying its details.

6. Viewing All Accounts:
   - The `viewAllAccounts` method iterates through the `HashMap` and prints all bank accounts stored.

7. Linking Expenditures:
   - The `linkExpenditure` method allows the user to enter an account ID and an expenditure code. If the account exists, the expenditure code is added to the account's list of expenditure codes.

Example Usage

- Adding a Bank Account:
  - The user is prompted to enter the account ID, bank name, and initial balance. After entering the details, the account is created and stored.

- Viewing a Specific Account:
  - The user can enter an account ID to retrieve and display its details. If the account does not exist, a message indicating that the account was not found is displayed.

- Viewing All Accounts:
  - The user can view all bank accounts by selecting the appropriate menu option. The application lists all accounts currently stored in the `HashMap`.

- Linking an Expenditure:
  - The user can link an expenditure code to a specific account by entering the account ID and the expenditure code. If the account exists, the code is added to the account's expenditure list.

Potential Improvements

1. Input Validation:Implement checks to ensure that the account ID is unique, the balance is a valid number, and the expenditure code is not empty.
2. Data Persistence:Consider saving bank accounts and expenditures to a file or database so that they persist between application runs.
3. Enhanced User Interface:Improve the user interface for better usability, possibly by using a graphical user interface (GUI) instead of a console application.
4. Error Handling:Add error handling for invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values for balance.

Conclusion

This Java application provides a basic framework for managing bank accounts and linking expenditures. It can be expanded and improved based on user needs and requirements.

1.Expenditure Records

Objective:
Record expenditure details:
-Code, Amount, Date, Phase, Category, Account Used
-Store records using HashMap or LinkedList
-Retrieve by Expenditure Code




The provided Java code implements a simple console application for managing expenditure records. It allows users to add expenditures and view them by their unique code. Below is a breakdown of the code and its functionality:

 Code Breakdown

1. Expenditure Class:
   - This class represents an expenditure record with attributes: `code`, `amount`, `date`, `phase`, `category`, and `accountUsed`.
   - It has a constructor to initialize these attributes and an overridden `toString` method for displaying the expenditure details.

2. ExpenditureRecords Class:
   - This is the main class containing the `main` method and the logic for the application.
   - It uses a `HashMap` to store expenditures, where the key is the expenditure code and the value is the `Expenditure` object.

3. Main Menu:
   - The application runs in a loop, displaying a menu with options to add an expenditure, view an expenditure by code, or exit the application.
   - User input is handled using a `Scanner`.

4. Adding Expenditures:
   - The `addExpenditure` method prompts the user for details about the expenditure, creates an `Expenditure` object, and stores it in the `HashMap`.

5. Viewing Expenditures:
   - The `viewExpenditure` method allows the user to enter an expenditure code and retrieves the corresponding `Expenditure` object from the `HashMap`, displaying its details.

Example Usage

- Adding an Expenditure:
  - The user is prompted to enter details such as code, amount, date, phase, category, and account used. After entering the details, the expenditure is recorded.

- Viewing an Expenditure:
  - The user can enter the code of an expenditure to retrieve and display its details. If the code does not exist, a message indicating that the expenditure was not found is displayed.

Potential Improvements

1. Input Validation: Implement checks to ensure that the amount is a valid number and that the date is in the correct format.
2. Data Persistence: Consider saving expenditures to a file or database so that they persist between application runs.
3. Enhanced User Interface: Improve the user interface for better usability, possibly by using a graphical user interface (GUI) instead of a console application.
4. Search Functionality: Add functionality to search expenditures by other attributes, such as date or category.

Conclusion

This Java application provides a basic framework for managing expenditure records. It can be expanded and improved based on user needs and requirements.
